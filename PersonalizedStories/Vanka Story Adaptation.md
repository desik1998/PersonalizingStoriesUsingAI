The below is the Indian Adaptation of the famous [story Vanka](https://americanliterature.com/author/anton-chekhov/short-story/vanka/) by Russian author Anton Chekhov. The story has been completely generated by o1 model and here is the [chat](https://chatgpt.com/share/676c0aca-04a0-8011-b81a-e6577126e1b9). I've made very very minor nit changes in the story

**CHOTU’S LETTER**

Chotu was nine years old. He had come from his village to the city of **Kanpur** to learn shoemaking under **Basant Lal Mochi**. It was the night of **Diwali** and Basant, his wife and the two older workers had gone out to watch the aarti at the temple and see the fireworks. Chotu had to stay behind and sit in the dimly lit workshop.

When he was sure that everyone was gone, he gently took out a dusty bottle of ink and an old pen from a wooden box. He found a crumpled piece of paper and placed it on a low stool. Glancing at the door and window to make sure nobody was watching, he knelt down and began writing:

**“Dear Dadaji Ramprasad,”** he wrote in shaky letters. **“Pranam to you. I hope your Diwali is going well. I love you so much and request you to read this letter.”**

He stopped for a moment and looked at the small picture of Goddess Lakshmi on the wall lit by a single oil lamp. Near the lamp were pieces of leather and wooden shoe shapes. Chotu thought of Dadaji Ramprasad, who worked as a watchman in their village. Even though he was about sixty-five years old, Dadaji was still quick on his feet. He always had a joke ready and his cheerful smile was known to everyone.

Each night, Dadaji walked around the landlord’s big house tapping his **lathi** on the ground. Two dogs followed him everywhere. One was **Sheru** and the other **Kalu**. Sheru was friendly, wagging his tail at everyone. But Kalu was clever and sneaky. Sometimes he even stole food from kitchens in the village and people got angry. But each time they chased him away, he came back, wagging his tail as if nothing had happened.

Chotu imagined Dadaji standing at the gate of the landlord’s house right now, talking to the servants and breathing out clouds of warm air in the cold. He might be chewing **paan** and joking about how Sheru and Kalu were the best guards in the village. Then he would look at the dark sky and say, “Arre, it’s a nice night, let’s see who else is awake!”

Chotu sighed and dipped his pen back into the ink. He wrote:

"""
Dadaji, Basant Lal hits me almost every day. Yesterday, he dragged me outside by my hair and beat me with a wooden tool, just because I fell asleep while taking care of his baby. His wife, Shanti Devi, once rubbed a wet cloth in my face because I accidentally burned a roti. The older workers always tease me. They make me buy them things from the corner shop, and if I say no, they call me names. 

I am always hungry, Dadaji. In the morning, I only get a dry roti. At lunch, I get watery dal and maybe half a roti. At night, I again eat just a roti, while they have sabzi or sweets. I sleep in a narrow corner near the workshop and when the baby cries, I must wake up and soothe her. Due to all of this, I feel very tired.
"""

He stopped writing and rubbed his eyes. Tears made his vision blur. He remembered how, in the village, Dadaji would share simple but filling meals with him—fresh rotis, dal and maybe some pickles. They did not have fancy food but Chotu never felt hungry. He thought of how they would sit under a neem tree in the afternoon, talking about small things and laughing.

Chotu continued writing:

"""
Dadaji, please save me from here. Take me back to the village. I swear I will do any work you say. I will help the landlord’s cook, I will feed the cows or I will even fetch water from the well. I promise I will never trouble you. If I do, you can scold me. At least I will be with you and not so scared. 

If I try to run away now, I have no shoes for the cold night. I am afraid of the streets here with too many people, too many cars and buses. And when I grow older, I will take care of you. I will make sure nobody bothers you.
"""

He remembered his mother, who used to work in the landlord’s house before she died. She loved him dearly and taught him to read simple words. When she fell sick and passed away, Dadaji took him in. For a few months, they managed together, but soon they decided Chotu needed to learn a trade in the city. That was how he came to Kanpur.

Chotu dipped his pen again, thinking of the busy city:

"""
This place is very big, Dadaji. There are shops full of shoes and clothes. The roads are crowded with rickshaws, autos, and bikes. I have seen big stores that sell fancy things once. There are also shops selling guns, but I don’t know who buys them. There are so many people here, but I still feel lonely. 

They burst firecrackers for Diwali and the whole city is bright. But I just want to be with you under the stars in our village, lighting a few small phooljharis and sharing sweets.
"""

He recalled last Diwali at the village. Dadaji had taken him on a bullock cart to gather sticks. They joked around and picked some flowers. Later, they lit diyas outside their hut, and some neighbors gave them homemade laddus. Dadaji teased him, “Don’t eat too many sweets or you won’t have teeth left!” Chotu laughed and tried to hide the laddu in his pocket.

He wrote more:

"""
When you cut wood near the fields, Dadaji, I still remember your stories. You told me how you used to swing me in your arms when I was a baby. You kept me warm in your shawl when it was cold. I wish you were here now, because I feel so alone. 

Kalu and Sheru might be running around your feet right now, hoping for scraps of food. Here in Kanpur, some stray dogs roam the streets, but they do not belong to me the way Kalu and Sheru do. Sometimes I feed them a bit of leftover roti, but they do not wag their tails like our dogs.
"""

The pen nib scratched on the paper. He carefully folded the letter, taking care that the ink did not smudge. He looked at the old envelope he bought for half a rupee from a small shop. He slipped the letter inside and wrote on the front:

**“To Dadaji, Ramprasad, Watchman. Ghao near Ganga Ghat.”**

He did not know the correct pin code or full address. But he remembered the shopkeeper’s advice: “Just drop it in the red post-box near the main road and the postman will carry it wherever it needs to go”. With hope, Chotu tucked the envelope under his arm, put on his worn-out chappals and quietly opened the door.

Outside, the air was smoky from firecrackers. Colourful lights still glowed along the shops and rooftops. Chotu heard children laughing, bursting crackers and waving phooljharis. He walked quickly, hugging the envelope close. He reached the post-box, which was tall and painted red. Standing on tiptoe, he pushed the envelope through the slot. It made a soft thump and vanished inside.

For a moment, Chotu felt both relief and worry. He wondered if the letter would truly reach Dadaji. Would the postman understand the address? Would Dadaji come soon? The night breeze was chilly, so Chotu hurried back to the workshop.

Inside, he lay down on the ragged cot, pulling a thin sheet over himself. The lantern was almost out, so only shadows moved across the walls. Soon, Basant Lal and his family might return, smelling of incense and oil lamps. Chotu hoped they would not notice the ink on his fingers.

He closed his eyes. Sleep fell on him heavily. In his dream, he saw **Dadaji** sitting near a small clay stove in the village, reading the letter out loud. **Sheru** and **Kalu** lay on the ground, wagging their tails, as if they too understood the words. The landlord’s cook, who stood by, said, “Ramprasad, go get the boy. He needs you.” Dadaji nodded and patted both dogs on the head. He said, “We’ll go fetch him. Let’s see if that shoemaker dares to stop me.”

Chotu smiled in his sleep. He felt as if he was already back in the village. He could almost smell the warm rotis on the chulha. He heard Dadaji’s laughter echo under the neem tree, and for a moment, he forgot all his troubles.

Outside, the last few crackers burst into the sky, scattering bright sparks. A soft glow spread from the oil lamps still burning in the streets. And somewhere, inside the red post-box, a simple letter began its long journey home.
