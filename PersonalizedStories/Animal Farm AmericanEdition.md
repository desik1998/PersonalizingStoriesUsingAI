# ANIMAL FARM: AMERICAN EDITION

## CHAPTER I

Farmer Johnson, who owned Maplewood Farm, had forgotten to close the chicken coop after wandering home late from the Rusty Creek Saloon. He was so drunk that he barely remembered to lock the horses in for the night. Waving his flashlight in wobbling arcs, he staggered across the yard, threw off his muddy boots by the back porch, poured himself a final shot of whiskey from the kitchen cabinet, and stumbled upstairs to bed, where Mrs. Johnson was already snoring loudly.

As soon as Farmer Johnson’s bedroom light went dark, a stir of excitement spread through all the barns and sheds on Maplewood Farm. Word had gotten around that Old Major—the prized Middle White boar—had experienced a strange dream the previous evening and wanted to share it with the other animals. Everyone had agreed to gather in the big, weathered barn as soon as Farmer Johnson was safely asleep. Old Major was well respected: though he’d once been shown at local fairs under his fancy name “Oakridge Beauty,” everyone just called him Old Major. He was so admired that all the animals were willing to lose some sleep to hear his speech.

Inside the big barn, Old Major was already settled on a raised platform of straw beneath a dim lantern, its light swinging gently from an overhead beam. He was twelve years old and had grown thick around the middle. Still, he was imposing, with a kind and wise expression—and his tusks, though never trimmed, gave him a regal look. One by one, the other animals arrived, each settling in his or her own style. First came the three dogs—Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher—followed by the pigs, who set themselves on the straw at the front. The hens perched on a row of old wooden windowsills, while the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters. Behind the pigs, the sheep and cows laid themselves down, chewing softly on what scraps they had. Then came Boxer and Clover, the two draft horses. They walked with immense caution, placing their thick hooves gently in case any small creature might be sleeping in the straw. Clover was a large, motherly mare, well into middle age, who’d never quite regained her trim figure after her fourth foal. Boxer was massive—over six feet at the shoulder—and said to be as strong as any two regular horses combined. He had a white stripe down his nose that gave him a trusting, almost dopey look. Though not very bright, he was revered for his steady nature and incredible work ethic.

Following the horses, Muriel the white goat and Benjamin the donkey entered. Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm and known for his bad mood. He rarely spoke, and when he did, it was usually a sarcastic remark. If asked why he never laughed, he’d say he found nothing amusing. He seemed mostly indifferent to everything, yet, quietly, he was devoted to Boxer; the two spent their rare free Sundays together in a little grassy plot behind the orchard, nibbling side by side in silence.

As the bigger animals got comfortable, a motherless batch of ducklings trailed in, peeping feebly, unsure of where to settle. Clover made a protective circle with her front leg, and the ducklings tucked themselves inside, promptly falling asleep. Finally, Mollie—the dainty white mare who pulled Farmer Johnson’s small cart—came dancing in, still chewing on a piece of sugar cube she’d snatched from the kitchen. She settled at the front, swishing her mane to display the pink ribbons woven through it, hoping someone would admire her. Last of all arrived the cat, who searched for the coziest place, then squeezed in between Boxer and Clover. She purred contentedly the entire time Old Major spoke, without listening to a single word.

Everyone was present except Moses, the tame raven who slept on a perch behind Farmer Johnson’s back door. Old Major cleared his throat, waited for the hush, and began:

> “Friends, you all heard that I had a strange dream last night. But I’ll speak of the dream soon. First, there’s something more urgent. I don’t expect to be with you much longer, and I feel duty-bound to share whatever wisdom I’ve gathered over my lifetime. I’ve had a long life—plenty of time to sit and think in my stall. I believe I understand the essence of our existence here on Earth, as well as any animal alive today. That is the matter I need to speak about.

> “Now, my friends, consider our lives. They are grimy, painful, and brief. We’re born, fed just enough to keep us going, and then those of us who can work are pushed to our last breath. The instant we become useless, we are sent off to the butcher. In all of America, is there a single animal who truly knows the meaning of happiness or rest once they pass their first year? We never taste freedom. The life of an animal is misery and slavery—pure and simple.

> “Is this just how nature works? Is it because our country is so poor? Absolutely not! Our farmland is fertile, and it could easily feed far more animals than it does now, in comfort. This single farm—Maplewood Farm—could sustain a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of hens, and still grant them a dignified life. Why then do we suffer? Because nearly all the fruits of our labor are stolen by human beings. There it is: the root of all our troubles. It can be summed up in one word—Man. Remove Man, and we are freed from hunger and overwork forever.

> “Man is the only creature that takes without producing. He doesn’t give milk, doesn’t lay eggs, is too frail to pull a plow. He can’t outrun a rabbit. Yet he’s lord of all the animals. He directs us to work for him and gives us the bare minimum so we don’t starve. The rest he keeps for himself. Our labor tills these fields; our manure enriches them. Yet not one of us owns anything more than our own body. You cows, how many gallons of milk did you yield last year? And what happened to all that milk that could have nourished your calves? Every drop went down the throats of our enemies. And you hens, how many eggs did you lay, and how many hatched into chicks? Most were shipped to market to earn cash for Johnson and his workers. You, Clover, have borne foals who should’ve been the pride of your old age—but each one sold at a year old. You’ll never see them again. All in return for your many labors is just your stall and a ration of feed.

> “Even the pitiful existence we live isn’t permitted to run its natural course. Me—I don’t complain, for I’ve been lucky. I’m twelve, and I’ve fathered hundreds of piglets. That’s normal for a pig, but in the end, no animal avoids the butcher’s knife. You young pigs up front, each one of you will scream your life away on a chopping block within a year. Every single one: cows, hogs, hens, sheep. Even the horses and dogs are no better off. Boxer, that day your mighty muscles give out, Johnson will sell you to the glue factory, which will cut your throat and boil you down for scraps. As for the dogs, once they get old and toothless, Johnson ties bricks to their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.

> “Isn’t it crystal clear, then, that every evil in our lives comes from the tyranny of humans? Get rid of Man, and our harvest becomes ours alone. Overnight, we’d be rich and free. What must we do? Work day and night—heart and soul—for the overthrow of mankind! That’s my message to you, friends: Rebellion! I can’t say exactly when this Rebellion will happen—it might be next week or years from now—but as sure as I see straw under my hooves, sooner or later justice will be done. Fix your eyes on this all your remaining days. Above all, pass my words on to those who come after you, so future generations can continue the struggle until we are victorious.

> “And remember, your resolve must never weaken. Don’t be swayed by arguments claiming animals and humans share interests. That’s a lie. Man serves no one but himself. Among us, let there be perfect unity. All men are our enemies; all animals are comrades.”

A big commotion erupted just then. Four large rats had scurried out from their holes to listen and were spotted by the dogs. The rats barely escaped with their lives by racing back into the shadows. Old Major raised a hoof for silence.

> “Friends,” he said, “we have a pressing question. The wild creatures—rats and rabbits—are they friends or foes? Let’s vote: Are rats our comrades?”

They voted immediately and decided overwhelmingly that rats were friends. Only four dissented—the three dogs and the cat. (Later, it was discovered that the cat voted on both sides.) Old Major continued:

> “I have little left to add. I only repeat—treat mankind as your mortal enemy. Whatever walks on two legs is an enemy. Whatever walks on four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And when you fight against Man, don’t come to resemble him. Even when you conquer him, don’t adopt his vices. No animal must ever live in a house, sleep in a bed, wear clothes, drink alcohol, handle money, or trade. All human habits are evil. Above all, no animal must ever tyrannize another. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill another. All animals are equal.

> “Now, I promised to share my dream. I can’t quite describe it—it was a vision of the earth once Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something I’d nearly forgotten. Long ago, my mother and the other sows sang an old tune, of which they only remembered the melody and a few words. I knew it in my piglet days, but it faded from my mind—until last night. The lyrics returned, ones I’m sure were sung by animals ages ago, and they’d been lost to time. Let me teach you that song now. It’s called *Beasts of the Land.*”

Old Major cleared his throat and began. Though his voice was hoarse, the melody was uplifting, somewhere between a country ballad and a barn dance tune. The words ran:

> **Beasts of the Land, from coast to coast,  
> Hear our call, from each fence post,  
> Great news we bring of days ahead  
> When Man is gone and fear is shed.**

> **Soon or late that day will come,  
> Man the tyrant will succumb,  
> Our fields will ring with our free cries,  
> And we alone will claim the prize.**

> **No more shall ring, bit, or whip,  
> Nor chains that scar, nor cruel tip,  
> All that’s sweet from hay to grain  
> Will be ours to share again.**

> **Look ahead to fields so fine,  
> Streams so clear, and bright sunshine,  
> Where the breeze is all our own,  
> And every beast can roam.**

> **For that day we labor on,  
> Even if we die ere dawn,  
> Horses, dogs, and all who yearn,  
> Struggle on till Man we spurn!**

> **Beasts of the Land, from coast to coast,  
> Each new voice shall raise this toast:  
> Sing out loud, and pass the word,  
> Till freedom’s roar is heard!**

The singing whipped the crowd into a frenzy of delight. Even before Old Major was done, many animals had picked up the tune, at least part of it, while the sharper ones—like the pigs and dogs—memorized it almost instantly. They sang *Beasts of the Land* a half-dozen times over. Cows mooed the melody, dogs barked it, sheep bleated it, horses whinnied it, ducks quacked it, and so on. They might have kept singing all night if they hadn’t been interrupted.

Farmer Johnson, awakened by the uproar, jumped out of bed, assuming some fox had gotten into the poultry yard. He grabbed the shotgun from the corner of his closet and fired a spray of buckshot into the darkness. Pellets smashed into the barn wall, and the meeting ended in a hurry. Everyone dashed off to their sleeping spots. Birds fluttered to their perches; larger animals sank into the straw. Within moments, Maplewood Farm lay silent under the stars.

## CHAPTER II

Three nights later, Old Major passed away in his sleep. They buried him at the foot of a small apple orchard.

It was still early spring. During the next few months, the smarter animals prepared quietly for the Rebellion Old Major had prophesied. None knew if it would happen soon or far in the future, but they sensed it was their duty to be ready. The planning fell mostly on the pigs, who were recognized as the most intelligent animals. Among them, two young boars led the way: Snowball and King. (King was the only Berkshire on Maplewood Farm. He was big, silent, and had an intense stare, known for always getting his way. Snowball was livelier, good at speeches, and more inventive, though not quite as deep in character. But the rest of the male pigs on the farm were just plump porkers. The best known was a chubby, quick-moving little pig named Squealer, famous for his round cheeks, glinting eyes, and shrill voice. He was an expert at persuasion, and folks said he could turn black into white if he talked long enough.)

These three—Snowball, King, and Squealer—transformed Old Major’s teachings into a full belief system they called “Animalism.” Many nights, once Farmer Johnson was snoring, they held secret meetings in the barn to explain Animalism to everyone else. They met with confusion early on. Some creatures wanted to stay loyal to “Mr. Johnson.” Others asked things like, “He feeds us. Without him, won’t we starve?” or “What’s it matter if the Rebellion is bound to happen anyway? Why bother working for it?” The pigs tried to clarify that such ideas clashed with Animalism’s heart. The silliest questions came from Mollie, the pretty white mare. Her very first query to Snowball was, “Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?”

“No,” Snowball replied. “We have no way to make sugar here. Besides, you don’t need sugar. You’ll have all the hay and oats you want.”

“And may I still wear ribbons?” Mollie asked with wide eyes.

“Friend,” said Snowball, “those ribbons you love so much are a sign of slavery. Can’t you see that being free is worth more than ribbons?”

Mollie agreed but didn’t look fully convinced.

The pigs also had to deal with Moses, the tame raven and Farmer Johnson’s pet. Moses was a tattle-tale and a gossip. He claimed to know of a magical place called Sugarhill Mountain, somewhere in the sky, where all animals supposedly go when they die. There, every day was Sunday, the clover never wilted, and sweet lumps of sugar grew on hedges. Most animals hated Moses because he lazed around and never worked, but some believed in Sugarhill Mountain, and the pigs had to argue hard to persuade them it was nonsense.

The two horses, Boxer and Clover, became the pigs’ most devoted followers. Though neither was very sharp, once they accepted the pigs as teachers, they passed on every word with simple, solid reasoning, and always attended the secret barn meetings. They led in singing *Beasts of the Land,* which ended each gathering.

Then, surprisingly, the Rebellion happened more swiftly and easily than anyone expected. Farmer Johnson, once a strict boss, had recently fallen on tough times after a bad lawsuit and had taken to drinking more heavily than ever. He’d sit for days in his rickety recliner, reading old newspapers and sipping whiskey, occasionally throwing crusts soaked in booze to Moses. His hired hands were idle and dishonest, the farmland overrun with weeds, the buildings in disrepair, and the animals underfed.

By late June, the hay was nearly ready for harvesting. The night before the first cutting, Farmer Johnson got so drunk in the local saloon that he didn’t return until midday Sunday. His crew had milked the cows in the early morning but didn’t bother feeding the rest of the animals, then went off to hunt rabbits. Johnson, stumbling into the house, collapsed on the couch with a newspaper over his face. Evening came, yet the animals still had no dinner. At last, they’d had enough. A hungry cow kicked the door of the feed shed, and the rest helped themselves. The noise jolted Johnson awake. Within minutes, he and four workers stormed the shed with whips, lashing in every direction. This was more than starving beasts could tolerate. Without planning, they turned on their tormentors. Johnson and his men were pummeled with kicks and horns. Startled by such fierceness, they fled. Within moments, they were running down the driveway to the county road, with the animals chasing and bellowing behind them.

Mrs. Johnson peeked out a window. Seeing the chaos, she scrambled, stuffed a few items in a small travel bag, and slipped off the farm by a back path, with Moses the raven flapping overhead. The animals slammed the gate behind them. Moments later, Maplewood Farm was theirs.

For a few minutes, they could scarcely believe their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop around the entire perimeter, ensuring no human lingered. Then, full of excitement, they dashed back to the buildings to destroy all the evidence of Farmer Johnson’s cruel reign. They broke open the harness room, tossing bits, nose rings, dog chains, castration knives—everything—into the nearby well. They hurled halters, blinkers, feed-bags, and whips onto a bonfire in the yard, cheering wildly as each item went up in flames. Snowball tossed in the ribbons used on the horses’ manes and tails at county fairs.

“Ribbons,” he said, “are like clothing—marking a human custom. All animals go bare.”

When Boxer heard that, he fetched the little straw hat he wore in summer to keep flies away and chucked it into the fire too.

In almost no time, the animals had purged all the reminders of Farmer Johnson. Then King led them to the feed room and handed out double rations of corn, with two biscuits for each dog. They sang *Beasts of the Land* in triumphant unison many times before settling for the night in what felt like the soundest sleep of their lives.

At dawn, they awoke and rushed into the field, remembering anew the glorious event. They raced up a small rise that provided a wide view: everything they saw was theirs! Overcome with joy, they dashed about, rolling in the dewy grass, rooting up dark clumps of soil, marveling at the orchard, the pond, the fields thick with soon-to-be-cut hay. It felt as if they’d never truly seen these familiar places before—and to realize it all belonged to them now was overwhelming.

Returning to the farmhouse, they paused outside, uneasy. That belonged to them too, but it gave them chills to step inside. Finally, Snowball and King butted the door open, and they filed in with hushed steps, fearful of disturbing anything. They moved from room to room, in awe at the plush furniture, the polished mirrors, the fine carpets, and the photo of Abraham Lincoln over the mantle. They were about to leave when Mollie was found in the master bedroom, admiring herself in the dressing mirror with a bright ribbon she’d found. The others scolded her, and they rejoined the group. No one touched a single item—except for a rack of smoked hams in the kitchen, which they promptly buried, and a forgotten barrel of whiskey, which a single kick from Boxer smashed to bits. It was unanimously decided the farmhouse would be preserved as a kind of museum, never to be lived in.

After a hearty breakfast, Snowball and King gathered the animals in the front yard.

“Friends,” Snowball began, “it’s half past six. We have a long day ahead. Our first task is to get in the hay harvest. But there’s something more urgent to handle first.”

They revealed that over the last three months, they had learned to read and write by studying an old spelling primer left by Farmer Johnson’s kids. King retrieved pots of black and white paint, then led everyone down to the main gate. Snowball, gripping a brush in his trotters, painted over “MAPLEWOOD FARM” on the arch, writing “ANIMAL FARM” in its place. This would be the farm’s new name. Returning to the big barn, Snowball climbed a ladder with Squealer’s help. He explained that from their studies, the pigs had summarized the teachings of Animalism into Seven Commandments. These would be painted on the barn wall, forming an unalterable law for every creature. Carefully, in large letters visible from thirty yards, Snowball wrote:

> 1. Whatever goes on two legs is an enemy.  
>  2. Whatever goes on four legs, or has wings, is a friend.  
>  3. No animal shall wear clothes.  
>  4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.  
>  5. No animal shall drink alcohol.  
>  6. No animal shall kill any other animal.  
>  7. All animals are equal.

Except for a couple of minor spelling mistakes, it looked good. Snowball read it aloud, and those who grasped it right away nodded in agreement.

“Now, friends,” Snowball said, tossing aside his paintbrush, “to the hay fields! Let’s show we can harvest faster than Johnson and his men ever did!”

But just then, three cows began bellowing anxiously. They hadn’t been milked since the day before, and their udders were painfully swollen. The pigs quickly fetched buckets and, with their dexterous trotters, milked the cows. Soon there were five frothy pails of creamy milk. Many animals looked on curiously.

“What’s going to happen to all that milk?” asked someone.

Farmer Johnson used to stir it into our mash,” the hens noted.

“Never mind the milk,” said King, placing himself in front of the buckets. “We’ll handle that later. The harvest is more important. Snowball, lead the way. I’ll join in a few minutes. Let’s go, friends! The hay can’t wait.”

So the animals headed out to the fields. By nightfall, the milk was gone.

## CHAPTER III

All summer, the animals worked like never before. And their efforts paid off, because the harvest exceeded their hopes. Sometimes the labor was tough, especially using tools made for human hands. But the pigs always devised clever solutions, and the horses—Boxer and Clover—knew the farmland so well they managed mowing and raking more skillfully than Farmer Johnson ever had. The pigs didn’t do manual labor themselves; they directed and organized. Their “superior brainpower,” as they called it, gave them authority to lead. Boxer and Clover gladly hooked up to the horse-drawn equipment, with a pig walking behind calling “Giddyup!” or “Whoa!” as needed. All animals, down to the ducks and chickens, took part in gathering hay. In the end, they finished the harvest in less time than it used to take Johnson and his men, and with no waste at all. Even the smallest bits of stray hay were found by the hens and ducks. Plus, nobody stole a single mouthful.

In those bright days, the animals felt happier than they’d imagined possible. Every bite tasted sweeter, knowing it was truly theirs—grown by them, for them, not rationed by a stingy master. With the lazy humans gone, there was more food for everyone and more time, even though they were novices at running a farm. Yes, they faced difficulties—for instance, threshing corn by hoof and blowing away chaff by breath, since they lacked a proper combine—but with the pigs’ planning and Boxer’s raw might, they overcame every obstacle. Boxer became the admiration of all. He’d been a hard worker before, but now he was tireless. Some days it felt as if the whole farm’s load rested on his broad shoulders. At dawn, a half-hour before anyone else woke, he’d slip out to do extra chores. He adopted a personal motto: “I will work harder,” repeating it whenever trouble struck.

Everybody pulled their weight as best they could—except Mollie, who disliked getting up early, often complaining of “stones in her hoof,” and the cat, who always disappeared whenever real work started, reappearing by mealtimes with her usual purr. Still, no one truly grumbled, because there was no real theft or bickering, and all shared the harvest. Only old Benjamin stayed the same grumpy donkey he’d always been, working in his slow, stubborn way, never volunteering but never quitting either. When asked if he was happier now that Johnson was gone, he’d only say, “Donkeys live a long time. None of you has seen a dead donkey,” and leave it at that.

Sundays, there was no farm work. Breakfast was an hour later, followed by a ceremony that began each week. First, the animals raised a hand-painted green flag (an old tablecloth Mrs. Johnson left behind, with a white hoof-and-horn design that Snowball had drawn) on a tall pole near the barn. The green stood for the farmland’s fields; the hoof and horn symbolized the new “Republic of Animals.” After the flag-raising, everyone gathered in the big barn for a general meeting. Farm policy for the coming week was discussed, resolutions proposed, and voted on. The pigs were the main speakers. The rest listened, voted, or sometimes contributed random remarks. Snowball and King sparred constantly. If Snowball wanted more barley planted, King insisted on oats, and so on. Snowball usually swayed the group with his articulate speeches, but King was better at quietly rallying support behind the scenes, especially with the sheep, who’d often interrupt Snowball’s clever arguments by bleating “Four legs good, two legs bad!” at critical moments. The Meetings always wrapped up with a round of *Beasts of the Land,* and the animals had the rest of Sunday for recreation.

The pigs set up their headquarters in the old harness room, reading and studying farm manuals, carpentry guides, and anything they could salvage from the house. Snowball formed all sorts of committees: a Hen Egg Committee, a Clean Tail Club for the cows, a Wild Friends Re-Education Committee (to tame squirrels, raccoons, wild rabbits), and so forth. He even started evening classes in reading and writing. Though mostly unsuccessful, these efforts did have one triumph: by autumn, nearly every animal could read at some level.

The pigs, of course, became fully literate. The dogs learned to read decently too but had no interest in anything beyond the Seven Commandments on the barn wall. Muriel the goat could read a bit better and sometimes read scraps of old newspapers to the others. Benjamin could read perfectly, but claimed there was nothing worth reading anyway. Clover learned the whole alphabet but found stringing letters into words too difficult. Boxer, despite repeated attempts, could get no further than the letter D. The moment he memorized E, F, G, H, he’d forget A, B, C, D, so eventually he settled on just the first four letters, rewriting them each day to stay fresh. Mollie refused to learn any letters except those spelling her own name; she’d arrange twigs to form “MOLLIE,” decorate them with flowers, then prance about admiring them.

Many simpler animals—sheep, hens, ducks—couldn’t get past A. Snowball decided that the Seven Commandments could be distilled into one guiding phrase: “Four legs good, two legs bad.” He said if they mastered this, they’d be safe from human influences. The birds objected, pointing out they had two legs, but Snowball explained that a wing was an instrument of flight, not manipulation, and therefore could be considered a leg. Man’s real weapon was a hand. The birds didn’t fully get his logic, but accepted it. The simpler creatures quickly memorized “Four legs good, two legs bad,” and would chant it for hours, especially the sheep, who bleated it endlessly whenever the chance arose.

Meanwhile, King paid little attention to Snowball’s committees. He said teaching the young was more important than fussing with grown animals. Shortly after the hay was in, two dogs, Bluebell and Jessie, gave birth to nine healthy puppies. The moment they were weaned, King whisked them away to a small loft, where he claimed he’d personally oversee their education. The rest of the farm soon forgot the puppies even existed.

An unsettling mystery arose: the missing milk. After the first day’s milking, it had vanished. A similar question came up later about fallen apples. Many windfalls lay in the orchard, and most animals assumed they’d be shared equally. Instead, King announced all apples must be collected for the pigs. Some murmured in doubt, but King, Snowball, and Squealer insisted. Squealer explained:

> “Friends! Surely you don’t think we’re hogging these apples out of selfishness? We pigs don’t even like milk or apples much. The only reason we consume them is to maintain our health—vital for leading the farm. According to science, milk and apples contain substances absolutely necessary for a pig’s well-being. We’re the brainworkers; we plan, manage, and look out for your welfare. If we fail in our duties, Farmer Johnson might come back. Do you want that?”

Of course, nobody wanted Johnson to return. So the milk and windfall apples remained pig property, and eventually no one questioned it further.

## CHAPTER IV

By late summer, word of the Animal Farm Rebellion had traveled across much of the county. Snowball and King regularly sent out flocks of pigeons, instructing them to visit animals on neighboring farms, share news of how Maplewood Farm (now called Animal Farm) had driven away Farmer Johnson, and teach them to sing **Beasts of the Land**. Everywhere, the story took on a life of its own—local farmhands whispered about an amazing place run entirely by four-legged workers, with no humans left in charge.

Meanwhile, Farmer Johnson himself spent his days sulking in the bar in town, complaining bitterly about being chased off his own property by a bunch of “uppity animals.” Although some of the other local landowners sympathized, most were too busy guessing how they might profit from his misfortune. At the same time, each one felt uneasy about the idea of animals running a farm on their own. If this Rebellion business spread, they worried their own livestock might get similar ideas.

Among these neighbors, two farmers stood out. The first was **Mr. Pilkington**, who owned Foxwood Farm, a large but poorly managed place. He was a relaxed fellow who spent most days fishing at the lake or hunting in the woods, letting his fences fall into disrepair. The second was **Mr. Frederick**, who owned Pinchfield Farm. He was known as a tough, frugal man, forever embroiled in lawsuits and infamous for driving the hardest bargains in the region.

Pilkington and Frederick detested each other so much they could barely agree on anything. But they were in full agreement that Animal Farm posed a dangerous example. At first, they tried to laugh off the notion that a bunch of pigs and horses could successfully run farmland. They spread rumors that the animals at Maplewood (they refused to call it Animal Farm) were constantly fighting among themselves and on the brink of starvation. But time passed, and the animals at Animal Farm hadn’t died of hunger nor turned on each other. So the neighbors changed their tone, insisting the animals there practiced horrifying customs—stuff like cannibalism or torturing each other with makeshift weapons. “It’s against the natural order,” they’d exclaim. Of course, these charges were nonsense, but plenty of folks still believed them.

Despite these rumors, the idea of a farm owned by its own beasts continued to spark curiosity. Tales of “Animal Farm” stirred restlessness on the local ranches: bulls became ornery and charged at fences, sheep slipped through open gates to gorge on fresh grass, and some horses refused to be saddled. Even a few farm dogs started ignoring whistles and commands. And everywhere, the tune of **Beasts of the Land** seemed to pop up—whistled in back pastures, barked by stray hounds at night, cooed by pigeons on barn rooftops. Though many humans called the tune silly, it rattled them. Something about its repeated promise of a “golden day” for animals made them uneasy.

Early in October, after the corn harvest at Animal Farm was nearly finished, a frantic flock of pigeons swooped into the barnyard with alarming news: Farmer Johnson, along with a crew of men from the neighboring farms, was headed up the driveway. They were about a dozen men in total, armed with clubs and at least a couple of shotguns, marching up the dirt road toward the main yard. Clearly, they meant to seize back the farm if they could.

Fortunately, the animals had expected some kind of attack. Snowball, who’d studied some old books about military tactics he’d found in the farmhouse attic—mostly about the Revolutionary War and Civil War battles—had taken the lead in planning their defense. He shouted instructions, and every animal hustled into position.

The moment Johnson and the other men approached the farm buildings, Snowball initiated his first line of attack. A squad of pigeons soared overhead, peppering the intruders with droppings, while a swarm of geese concealed in the hedgerow rushed out, flapping and hissing, nipping the men’s ankles. It was enough to cause a bit of confusion, but the men soon beat them off with their clubs and boots. Snowball then signaled the second wave: Muriel the goat, Benjamin the donkey, and several sheep ran straight at the intruders, butting and kicking, trying to keep them disorganized. Even so, the men again fought them off, and at one sharp whistle from Johnson, the men pressed forward, seemingly confident they could clear out these “dumb animals.”

Snowball then let out a loud squeal that signaled a feigned retreat. Muriel, Benjamin, and the sheep turned and bolted back into the barnyard. The men cheered and sprinted after them, hoping to rout the animals for good. But this was exactly what Snowball had planned. Once the men were in the middle of the yard, Snowball sounded a fresh cry, and out from behind the corners of the barn dashed Boxer, Clover, the rest of the pigs, and—crucially—King himself. The dogs bounded alongside them, snarling fiercely. The humans suddenly found themselves surrounded.

Snowball charged head-on at Farmer Johnson, who leveled his shotgun and fired, the blast grazing Snowball’s back. A few buckshot pellets ripped into one of the sheep, killing it instantly. Without hesitating, Snowball rammed Johnson in the midsection. Johnson tumbled into a muddy trough, losing his gun. Boxer reared up on his hind legs and lashed out with his heavy forehooves. With a single blow, he clobbered a stable-lad in the head, knocking him flat. At the sight of that brutal impact, the rest of the men panicked, dropping their clubs to scramble away. The animals chased them in every direction—cows gored at their backsides, dogs lunged for their legs, horses aimed powerful kicks. It was total chaos as the men frantically scrambled through the yard fence and fled down the road. Within minutes, the invaders had vanished, leaving behind battered weapons in their rush to escape.

The animals, breathing hard, gathered in the yard, hardly believing they’d won so decisively. Johnson had retreated, and not a single man remained on the property. Almost at once, they noticed Boxer standing over the motionless body of the stable-lad he’d struck. Boxer’s face was distraught.

“He’s dead,” he muttered sadly. “I didn’t mean—my hoof is so big—I only meant to scare him. Who will ever believe I didn’t do it on purpose?”

“Don’t feel bad, friend,” Snowball said, still panting, blood trickling from his wounded side. “War is war. The only good human is one who can’t harm us.”

Boxer shook his head, tears welling in his eyes. “I have no wish to kill anyone. Not even a human.”

Before they could say more, Mollie squealed from the barn. She’d been missing the entire fight, hiding with her nose buried in the hay in her stall. The stable-lad, meanwhile, had actually been just knocked out; he came to, groaned, and managed to scramble off the farm.

Back in the main yard, the animals dissolved into excited chatter, all telling their own version of the battle. The sheep who’d been shot was given an impromptu funeral near the orchard. Snowball gave a short speech, reminding them of Old Major’s vision and urging them never to lose faith. They proclaimed the day’s skirmish **The Battle of the Cowshed**, because that was where they’d launched their decisive ambush.

A vote was taken to award special honors. Snowball and Boxer were each given the new medal of **“Animal Hero, First Class.”** The sheep that died was recognized posthumously as **“Animal Hero, Second Class.”** The animals decided to keep Farmer Johnson’s shotgun, discovered lying in the mud, as a trophy. They set it by the base of the flagpole and agreed they would fire it twice a year: once on the anniversary of the Rebellion’s victory over Johnson, and again on the date of this **Battle of the Cowshed**. They marched around the yard, singing **Beasts of the Land** with renewed pride, as the last faint sound of the men’s footsteps faded down the road.

In the hush of that evening, everyone felt a strong sense of unity. For one shining moment, they were not just animals but defenders of their own hard-won freedom. Snowball, still limping a bit, vowed they would build a future so secure no human would ever threaten them again. King, standing off to the side with the dogs close by, said little. But the way he scanned the farmyard—as though taking inventory—did not go unnoticed by a few. Boxer, meanwhile, tried to keep his mind off the stable-lad he’d nearly killed, assuring himself that in order for the farm to stay free, perhaps such a sacrifice was necessary. With that sobering thought, the animals turned in for the night, exhausted but victorious, the faint glow of lantern light shining on the battered old barn walls, now marked with the proud memory of the day’s triumph.

## CHAPTER V

As winter approached, Mollie became more and more of a problem. She often wandered into the farmyard well after the other animals had started their morning chores and acted as if she had overslept. When questioned, she’d claim some vague ailment like a “sore hoof.” Yet nobody ever saw any real injury. The more pressing worry was the constant rumor that she was spotted standing near the fence line, talking to one of Mr. Pilkington’s farmhands, who’d pet her nose and offer her bits of sugar. Clover confronted her one chilly morning.

“Mollie,” said Clover, “I saw you near the hedge by Foxwood Farm. One of Pilkington’s men was right there, stroking your nose. You didn’t pull away.”

“He did not! I wasn’t—” Mollie stuttered, her eyes shifting. She pawed at the dirt with one hoof, clearly nervous.

“Mollie,” Clover persisted, “look me in the eye. Do you swear he wasn’t feeding you sugar?”

But Mollie couldn’t hold Clover’s gaze and soon spun around, trotting off with her tail swishing. Clover sighed and decided to check Mollie’s stall. Under the straw bedding she found a stash of sugar cubes and a few colored ribbons. Clover said nothing then, but the news quickly spread among the other animals.

Three days later, Mollie vanished. For a week, no one knew where she’d gone, until a flock of pigeons reported seeing her across the county. There she was, outside a fancy small-town stable, trotting around in a shiny harness. A red-faced man in checked overalls was giving her sugar, and Mollie seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement, ribbons and all. The animals decided they would never mention her again.

—

January arrived, bringing a brutal cold spell. The fields stayed frozen, and the ground was too hard to plow. The animals held Sunday meetings in the barn for warmth, reviewing plans for spring planting. By then it was accepted that the pigs—especially Snowball and King—were the ones who made all major policy decisions, though everyone got a vote at the weekly meeting. But Snowball and King disagreed on almost every point.

If Snowball proposed more planting of, say, barley, King would insist oats were more vital. If King recommended more corn, Snowball argued for more hay. Soon the whole farm broke into two factions: “Vote for Snowball and a brighter future!” vs. “Vote for King and secure supplies!” The animals listened to each side, but they couldn’t quite decide who was right, as each pig sounded convincing in different ways. Snowball’s speeches were lively and filled with visions of new, efficient ways to run the farm, while King quietly built support behind the scenes—especially with the sheep, who bleated “Four legs good, two legs bad!” at just the right moments to drown out any tricky question or debate.

Yet the fiercest quarrel was about a project Snowball had been planning for some time: building a windmill. High on a knoll behind the orchard stood a slight rise that got steady wind. Snowball insisted they could build a windmill there to generate electricity—maybe even enough to power machinery, run water pumps, and provide light. He had spent many evenings in an old toolshed reading mechanical books. Over the floor, he drew chalk diagrams of gears, blades, and wiring. The other animals, who could barely read, found these scribbles confusing. But Snowball painted a picture of a glorious, modern Animal Farm: heated stalls in winter, electric light bulbs in the barn, machines that would do the toughest labor. The animals listened, wide-eyed.

King, however, scoffed, saying the project was foolish. His opinion was that building the windmill would only distract them from the immediate challenge: growing enough feed. If they wasted time hauling stone and constructing this contraption, he warned, they might all starve. Most animals felt torn. Some days Snowball seemed right—imagine having power and less work! But then King would talk about starving in the cold, and they’d hesitate.

Outside of the windmill debate, there was also the question of defense. Ever since **The Battle of the Cowshed**, everyone expected a second attack from Mr. Frederick or Mr. Pilkington. Snowball’s plan was to spread the idea of rebellion among neighboring animals, so if all farms revolted, there’d be no need to fight. King argued they should collect weapons and train in firearms so they could defend themselves if needed. Again, the animals saw sense in both arguments, and each pig had his followers.

Finally, the Sunday arrived when the question of building the windmill would be put to a decisive vote. The animals gathered in the big barn, anxiously awaiting the outcome. Snowball stood first, launching into an impassioned speech. He described in vivid detail the marvels of electric power: how chores like milling and pumping water would be done by machines, letting everyone enjoy more free time. Many animals leaned forward, nodding, enchanted by his words.

Then King rose to speak. He was never as flashy a speaker, and now he spoke only a few terse sentences, reminding them that they already struggled to produce enough for winter, and that messing around with an untested idea could ruin them all. When King sat down, it wasn’t clear which way the vote might go. Sensing this, Snowball leapt to his feet again, voice ringing with emotion. He thundered that the windmill was the key to a life of ease, that their farm would become a beacon of progress to animals everywhere. The crowd was on the edge of cheering. Snowball was winning them over. Even Boxer stamped his great hooves in approval.

Suddenly, King let out a sharp, high-pitched squeal, unlike any they’d ever heard. At that moment, from outside the barn, nine enormous dogs charged in—dogs the animals barely recognized, but who had grown from the puppies King had “educated” in private. Each wore a spiked collar, snarling with bared teeth. Snowball saw them first and bolted for the exit. The dogs rushed after him, snapping inches from his tail. The onlookers gasped as Snowball sprinted across the yard; one dog managed to clamp down on Snowball’s hindquarters, but he kicked free. In a flash, Snowball squeezed through a broken board in the fence and disappeared. The dogs halted there, growling, unable to follow.

The animals crowded out of the barn, stunned by the sight. Snowball was gone. The dogs, panting, circled back to King, wagging their tails as if he were their master. Indeed, those pups had grown into a fierce private guard. King marched at a slow, measured pace, leading the dogs back toward the barn. Without missing a beat, he climbed onto the raised platform where Snowball had just been speaking. Looking out over the silent crowd, King announced that from now on, Sunday meetings would cease. The animals would assemble each week simply to hear their work orders, but there would be no more debates. Decisions about running the farm would be made by a special committee of pigs, led by himself.

Some of the pigs gasped in protest. Four young porkers tried to squeal a complaint, but the dogs erupted in low, menacing growls, and the sheep began bleating “Four legs good, two legs bad!” over and over until the uproar drowned out any objection. Seeing no room to argue, the farm fell silent.

That evening, Squealer made the rounds, speaking to groups of animals here and there. He explained that King had taken on a heavy responsibility—leading was no joy but a burden. If the animals made the wrong decisions, bad things might happen—like Mr. Johnson returning. Surely they did not want that. Those who remembered Snowball’s brave role in the Battle of the Cowshed hesitated; but Squealer hinted that Snowball’s heroism had been exaggerated, and loyalty to King was what truly mattered. “We don’t want to invite trouble,” he said in his squeaky yet persuasive tone. Boxer was troubled, but in the end he uttered, “If Comrade King says so, it must be right.” He adopted a second motto to go with “I will work harder,” which was: “King is always right.”

Within days, the changed routine took hold. The Sunday flag-raising and anthem remained, but debates were outlawed. The pigs faced no real challenge to their authority, and the nine dogs kept especially close to King. Occasionally one might ask, “What about that windmill Snowball wanted?” But they thought better of speaking out loud.

Then, in a startling announcement, King declared that the windmill project would, in fact, go forward after all. He explained that he had never truly opposed it. He pretended to, only to get rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous influence. Now that Snowball was gone, the plan could be done right. Squealer repeated that line whenever questioned—“It was King’s own idea in the first place!”—so often that many animals started believing it. Any confusion could be quickly settled by the dogs’ growls or the sheep’s chanting. So it was settled: They would build the windmill under King’s direction, and as winter faded, they prepared to begin collecting stone and sand. The farm’s future, it seemed, belonged to King and his committee—and Snowball was now nothing but a rumor on the far side of the fence.

## CHAPTER VI

All that year, the animals threw themselves into building the windmill. Every spare moment not spent on regular chores—tending fields, feeding livestock—went toward hauling rocks and gathering supplies. At first, they felt a surge of pride working on such a grand project. But soon it became clear that the task was far harder than Snowball’s neat diagrams had suggested.

There was a patch of stony ground near the orchard where they could get good-sized rocks. Yet these boulders were far too big to use as they were. With no human tools to break them up, the pigs suggested pulling each giant stone to the top of a rocky ledge, then letting it tumble down onto the hard ground. The crash usually cracked the stone into pieces. It was grueling work. Everyone who could tug a rope—horses, cows, even some sheep—hitched themselves to a harness and strained to drag rocks uphill, inch by inch. Anytime a boulder slipped, animals scattered to avoid being squashed. More than once, Boxer came close to injuring himself pushing from behind. Still, they made some progress, stacking the broken stones near where the windmill’s circular foundation would rise.

The labor proved draining in other ways. Despite their enthusiasm, the animals discovered they had less time to gather food and finish everyday jobs. The fields needed constant weeding, and autumn was coming fast. Also, King suddenly announced they would work Sundays, claiming it was “voluntary”—but anyone who didn’t show up would have their rations cut in half. Faced with hunger, few stayed away.

King’s presence was rarely seen during actual heavy lifting. By design, he and the other pigs mostly “supervised”—which meant giving orders or discussing technical points. The day-to-day management was explained by Squealer, who trotted around the site, praising the animals’ dedication or sometimes warning them to keep going. Meanwhile, King spent more and more time in the farmhouse or in a small shed he’d turned into an office. And always by his side or posted outside the door were the nine big dogs.

In spite of this, the animals generally didn’t complain. They found pride in constructing something for the future. Boxer especially kept morale up. Whatever the problem—like a stubborn chunk of granite or a frayed rope—he’d throw his shoulders into it, chanting, “I will work harder,” until everyone pitched in and got the job done. Day after day, they saw the windmill’s stone walls rising slowly, and it felt like real progress.

But as summer drew on, rumblings of trouble surfaced. The first worry was that they were running low on certain supplies: nails, wires, a few metal parts nobody knew how to manufacture. Even the feed store was short on some materials. King had a plan: they would sell some of the farm’s excess hay, wheat, and eggs to gather enough money for the items they desperately needed. Rumors spread that the hens, in particular, would be asked to give up more eggs for sale. Some animals recalled the original rule that there’d be no trading with humans, but no one spoke up openly. Then Squealer gave a short talk in the barn:

“Friends, this is purely business,” he said, whisking his curly tail. “We have no choice if we want the windmill to be completed. I trust you don’t think we pigs are doing it for our personal gain! We need to keep the farm running smoothly, which means some trade with neighboring folk. Of course, we’ll never let a human set foot here. We’ll use a go-between, a local solicitor named Mr. Whymper. Comrade King has already arranged it. Everything is under control.”

Despite some secret worries, the animals accepted Squealer’s explanation. Over the next few weeks, a trim, sharp-looking man with a briefcase—Mr. Whymper—began visiting on Mondays to discuss terms. The animals felt uneasy seeing any human stroll around, but they also felt a strange pride watching King stand on the farmhouse steps, talking “business” with a grown man. Word traveled fast among the local farms that Animal Farm must not be failing as once rumored; after all, it now had deals in place to sell produce and even order special equipment.

Just as the animals were adjusting to the idea of limited trading, another shocking development cropped up: the pigs moved into the farmhouse. At first, no one believed it. Then, one cloudy afternoon, a curious sheep peered through a window and saw Squealer setting out a dining table with plates. Another pig rummaged in Farmer Johnson’s old pantry. Disturbed, the sheep spread the word: the pigs were eating and sleeping in Johnson’s house!

A quiet uproar built among the animals. Several remembered a clear rule from the Seven Commandments—“No animal shall sleep in a bed.” Clover in particular was upset. She tugged Muriel aside and insisted they read her the Fourth Commandment again. Muriel spelled it out carefully from the barn wall: **“No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets.”** It turned out there were two extra words at the end—*“with sheets.”* Clover frowned; she thought it simply said no beds, but now it was different. Where had that bit about “with sheets” come from?

Almost on cue, Squealer arrived with a couple of dogs. Seeing their troubled faces, he launched into his well-rehearsed speech:

“Dear friends, you’re not accusing us pigs of breaking rules, I hope? The rule specifically bans sheets, a human invention. Surely you agree a bed of straw or a mattress is just a place to rest, right? You want Comrade King—who works so hard—to be rested for the sake of the farm, don’t you? We pigs are the brains here, busy with planning and paperwork. Do you think we could do that properly if we were exhausted from sleeping on a damp barn floor? Or are you hoping Farmer Johnson comes back because we couldn’t manage affairs?”

Hearing the threat of Johnson returning, everyone quickly reassured Squealer they were loyal. Boxer, as usual, gave the final word: “If Comrade King says it’s necessary, it must be right.” And that was that. No further mention was made of the pigs settling into the farmhouse. Meanwhile, more subtle changes rolled in—rumors that the pigs had discovered some leftover whiskey in the cellar, or that they’d grown fond of certain items from the pantry. But only whispered hints circulated, and no one asked openly.

The harvest that fall wasn’t as bountiful as they’d hoped, partly because so much time and muscle had gone into the windmill. The animals stayed mostly fed, yet they felt the pinch. As autumn gave way to winter, the windmill rose slowly to about halfway done. Many nights, Boxer did extra hauling by moonlight. Despite a constant ache in his muscles, he plodded on, determined to finish the walls before the worst frosts hit.

Early in November, a sudden cold front blew down from the north. Freezing rain pelted the countryside, giving way to sleet and howling winds. The half-built windmill shuddered under gusts. Then, one stormy night, an especially fierce gale battered Animal Farm. Tree branches snapped; shutters tore off hinges. The animals cowered in the barns, hearing the wind roar.

When morning broke, they emerged into a scene of devastation. Fallen limbs, scattered debris, and, most dreadful of all, the windmill was in ruins. Its stone walls lay in a heap, rock shards everywhere. Speechless with shock, they filed across the yard to stare at the wreckage. Boxer stood still, tears in his wide eyes. He mumbled, “All that work—gone.”

King came marching up, the dogs at his heels, snorting heavily. He walked around the rubble, inspected the broken stones, said nothing for a moment, then raised his head.

“This was no mere storm,” he declared in a dark tone. “I see footprints in the mud right here by the foundation. This is the work of Snowball!” He pronounced that name with loathing, tail rigid. “Snowball snuck back in the night to destroy what we built. It’s sabotage! We must punish the traitor. Dead or alive, we’ll get him. I offer a bounty of a bushel of apples for any animal who captures him. Or two bushels if brought alive!”

A ripple of rage spread through the crowd. If Snowball had done such a thing, it was unthinkable. The footprints King had pointed to could be anything, but no one questioned him. Straightaway, King announced they’d rebuild the windmill, stronger this time, with thicker walls. “We’ll show that rotten Snowball he can’t break our spirit,” King shouted. “Work begins tomorrow. And if we must labor through rain or snow, so be it!”

The animals, still trembling from the storm, gradually steeled themselves. They believed King’s story—terrible though it was—and decided they had no choice but to start over. As they scattered back to gather tools and feed, a heavy mood hung over the farm. It wasn’t just the windmill’s collapse that chilled their hearts; it was the sense that they were now truly in a state of siege. Snowball was out there, somewhere, an enemy to be hunted. They would have to pour every ounce of strength into rebuilding, no matter the cost. And King, glaring at the shattered stones, looked as though he was set on proving his power—both against Snowball and against any animal who dared question him.

## CHAPTER VII

A harsh winter settled in, fiercer even than the last. The fields lay frozen solid, and any ground not under snow was crusted with ice. Daylight hours were short and bitterly cold. But the animals worked doggedly to rebuild the windmill. King insisted the new walls be twice as thick, requiring double the stone. Every morning, the animals gathered at first light, harnessed ropes to giant boulders, and inched them up the slope. Boxer, though exhausted, refused to rest. Clover worried he was pushing himself too hard, but Boxer would only say, “I will work harder,” and plod on.

It was soon clear that the farm faced a serious food shortage. The fall harvest had been meager, partly because so much effort had gone into the windmill. With icy weather halting much of their normal foraging, the hay and corn began to run out. Ration portions shrank. Some nights, animals lay awake with growling stomachs. But King was determined to hide this problem from the outside world. He ordered Squealer to assure everyone that rations were ample, or at least no worse than before. Whenever Mr. Whymper came by on Mondays to check on business, the pigs staged little tricks—like filling half-empty storage bins with sand, then covering the top layer with grain so it looked full. Whymper would walk around, see the seemingly overflowing bins, and report back that Animal Farm was doing just fine.

Despite the secrecy, news must have leaked. Mr. Frederick and Mr. Pilkington started spreading new rumors that Animal Farm was on the brink of collapse, that the animals were slowly dying of hunger or tearing one another apart. This made King double down. He announced more “voluntary” Sunday labor, and that if any creature complained openly, they risked losing their share of feed altogether. Of course, no one dared speak up, so they braced themselves for endless days of hauling stone in freezing winds.

To make matters worse, King demanded more eggs to sell for extra cash. He claimed the money was needed for seeds and supplies. The hens, already weak from the winter, were horrified—he expected them to produce four hundred eggs a week! Led by three feisty Rhode Island Reds, the hens revolted, flying up to the top beams of the barn and laying their eggs there, letting them roll off and smash. King responded with brutal swiftness: he cut off the hens’ rations entirely and warned that any animal caught helping them would face punishment. The dogs enforced it, circling the coop so no scraps of food could be snuck to the hens. After five days, the hens, desperate and cold, surrendered. Nine had died of starvation. Officially, Squealer said they died of a disease called “coccidiosis.”

During this grim stretch, rumors swirled again about Snowball. King kept insisting Snowball was sneaking around at night, sabotaging the windmill, spoiling feed, breaking fences, even nibbling bark off orchard trees. Whenever something broke or disappeared, the blame fell on Snowball. The animals became paranoid. Though few had actually seen Snowball, King would sniff around suspiciously, claiming to pick up his scent in some corner. Often, the dogs would bark furiously at shadows. Everyone began to believe Snowball was lurking, a constant threat.

Then Squealer dropped a new bombshell: the claim that Snowball had been a traitor from the start, secretly in league with Farmer Johnson all along. Some animals who remembered Snowball’s bravery in **The Battle of the Cowshed** were puzzled. Hadn’t he been wounded by buckshot? Squealer insisted that was staged, that Snowball only pretended to be injured to gain their trust. Boxer, looking troubled, said he still believed Snowball had fought bravely. But when Squealer retorted that King’s official position was that Snowball was a criminal, Boxer only sighed, “If Comrade King says so, it must be right.” He added, “I will work harder,” as if trying to push aside his doubts.

A few days later, King ordered a special gathering in the yard. The animals lined up under the chilly sky. King emerged from the farmhouse, flanked by his dogs. At his sharp bark, four pigs were seized by the ears and dragged before everyone. The dogs snarled, and King demanded these pigs confess to plotting with Snowball. Trembling, the pigs confessed to meeting Snowball at night, working for Farmer Johnson’s return. Without warning, the dogs leaped and tore their throats out on the spot. Horrified, the animals could hardly react before three hens—those that led the egg protest—were also forced forward, confessing that Snowball had visited them in dreams. They were slaughtered on the spot. Then a goose admitted stealing corn, a sheep admitted urinating in the water trough, all supposedly under Snowball’s influence. One by one, they were executed. By the time it ended, a small pile of bodies stained the yard. The stench of blood was overpowering.

Stunned and shaking, the survivors slipped away to hide near the half-finished windmill or huddle under hedges. Clover and Benjamin stood on a small hill, looking down at the yard where bits of red snow marked the scene. Nobody had expected such violence among themselves—hadn’t they driven out Farmer Johnson for precisely this kind of cruelty? Clover silently recalled the earlier days, remembering Old Major’s dream of a fair farm where no animal would ever kill another. But here they were, drenched in fear and confusion.

That evening, led by Boxer’s trembling voice, some began singing **Beasts of the Land** in a soft, broken chorus. As if on cue, Squealer appeared, backed by two of the dogs, and announced that **Beasts of the Land** was now forbidden. “It was the anthem of the Rebellion,” he said gravely. “The Rebellion’s completed. There’s no need for it anymore.” The sheep started bleating “Four legs good, two legs bad!” so loudly that no one could protest. The old dreamlike vision of freedom they once shared suddenly felt very distant. Quietly, one by one, the animals bowed their heads and drifted into the barns, carrying the ache of betrayal in their hearts—and a growing dread that King’s iron grip was only tightening.

## CHAPTER VIII

A few days after the dreadful executions, Muriel happened to read over the Seven Commandments. She noticed something strange about the Sixth: instead of “No animal shall kill any other animal,” it now read **“No animal shall kill any other animal without cause.”** For a moment, she was sure it had been different before, but there it was in paint on the barn wall. When she mentioned it, Squealer insisted it had always been written that way. Uneasy as they were, most animals were too frightened to argue. They remembered the bloody scene in the yard and decided to keep their doubts quiet.

Meanwhile, life grew harder yet. The weather warmed and the windmill’s walls rose steadily, but every animal worked long hours, sometimes skipping lunch to haul more stone. King kept urging them to be vigilant against “Snowball’s traitorous attacks,” though no one had glimpsed Snowball since winter. Squealer regularly updated them with cheerful figures: egg production up by 200 percent, milk up by 300 percent, wheat yields hitting record highs—numbers that didn’t match anyone’s rumbling stomach. Yet the animals had nothing except Squealer’s claims to compare against, so they forced themselves to believe it.

Around this time, talk spread that King was bargaining to sell a large stack of leftover timber from the old orchard. He seemed torn whether to make a deal with **Mr. Pilkington** or **Mr. Frederick**, the two humans who owned nearby farms. Mr. Pilkington’s Foxwood was relaxed but run-down; Mr. Frederick’s Pinchfield was smaller, better run, but Frederick himself was ruthless, known for browbeating anyone he dealt with. One week, King acted friendly toward Pilkington; the next, rumors claimed he was in secret talks with Frederick. The animals heard contradictory stories about which of the two neighbors was the worse threat.

Suddenly, King announced that Frederick had offered a high price for the timber and that they’d reached an agreement. The animals felt uneasy—stories claimed Frederick abused his animals and was plotting an attack on Animal Farm. But Squealer insisted these were “lies started by Snowball.” He said Frederick had come around and was actually a decent man. Money changed hands: Frederick gave King a stack of large bills in exchange for the timber. Soon as the timber was carted away, however, the pigs discovered the worst: those bills were counterfeit. Frederick had paid with worthless paper! King went into a roaring rage, declaring “Death to Frederick!” and vowing vengeance. At the same time, word came that Frederick and a band of men were marching to seize the windmill.

Sure enough, at dawn, Frederick’s truck appeared on the road, men armed with shotguns and crowbars poured through the gate. The animals mounted a defense much like at the Battle of the Cowshed, but these attackers had learned caution. They fired shotgun blasts whenever the animals came close, forcing Boxer and the others to fall back. Slowly but surely, Frederick’s men advanced. Then they surrounded the windmill site. Two of them drilled a hole in the foundation, packed it with explosives, and lit the fuse. The animals watched in horror from a distance as the mighty windmill—built with months of backbreaking labor—blew apart in a deafening roar. Stones flew in every direction, leaving only a smoking crater.

Enraged beyond fear, the animals charged. They rushed the men, ignoring the blasts of buckshot. Boxer struck a man square in the chest, sending him flying. The dogs tore at another. Even old Benjamin wheeled around, lashing out with his small hooves. At last, seeing they might be overrun, the men panicked, scrambled back to their vehicles, and sped off. The yard was left in chaos. Several animals were dead or badly wounded, and the newly built windmill was nothing but scattered rubble. But Frederick was gone.

When the dust settled, the animals mourned their dead. Squealer stepped in, announcing a “great victory,” praising King’s leadership. Bewildered, the animals stared at the blasted remains of the windmill; victory felt hollow. Yet King personally pinned new medals on Boxer and some others, calling the fight **The Battle of the Windmill** and ordering the gun fired in celebration. A subdued ceremony followed, though nearly everyone was too sore or stunned to feel proud. That evening, in the farmhouse, the pigs found a hidden case of whiskey. The barnyard rang with loud singing from inside the house, so different from the lament outside. By morning, King appeared deathly sick, staggering about as if he might die. Rumors spread that Snowball had poisoned him. But by nightfall, King had recovered, issuing a new decree against alcohol. Soon, however, another alteration appeared on the barn wall: **“No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.”** The animals who noticed it shook their heads, remembering that once, they thought it simply said no animal could ever drink. But, as usual, they kept their doubts to themselves and went back to work, haunted by how quickly every rule seemed to bend, just like the windmill’s broken stones.

## CHAPTER IX

With the windmill destroyed a second time, the animals faced spring in a discouraged state. Still, King commanded that they must rebuild it—stronger yet again. Though weary and nursing injuries from the battle, the animals trudged back to hauling stone and mixing mortar. They found little comfort in Squealer’s announcements about each new “success” or “record high.” For most of them, life felt even tougher than before the Rebellion.

Boxer’s hoof, injured during the explosion, healed slowly. He did his best to hide the pain, limping only when he thought no one was watching. Clover often begged him to take it easy. “You’re past your prime,” she’d say gently. “You’ve done enough already.” But Boxer wouldn’t hear of it. He kept repeating “I will work harder” and “King is always right,” forcing himself to the quarry at daybreak. Deep down, Boxer had set a secret goal: he’d see the windmill finished before his retirement, which in theory was supposed to happen at age twelve, just a few months away.

Back when Old Major’s ideas were fresh, the farm had agreed on a set retirement age for each species, plus a promise of generous pensions. But no animal had ever actually retired, and no real plan for such a pasture or pension seemed to exist. Quietly, some remembered that this had been promised: when a horse turned twelve, they’d graze in comfort, get extra feed, and never have to work again. Those were sweet thoughts, but each time anyone brought up the “retirement corner” in the orchard, Squealer would insist they needed that land for barley or corn, especially now with feed scarce. So the retirement notion faded into wishful thinking.

Meanwhile, rations were cut again. Even though the pigs continued to publish “facts” about how well they were doing, the animals felt the cuts. They were always hungry, forcing down chaff and the few root vegetables left in storage. Once again, the hens had to yield more eggs, the cows had to give more milk. But the pigs never seemed to go short. In fact, some of the pigs appeared to be putting on weight.

One day, the four sows gave birth simultaneously, producing a big batch of piglets—thirty or so. Everyone guessed who the father was (King, of course), though no one dared say it out loud. Construction began on a makeshift “schoolroom” in the farmhouse garden for these young pigs, who were clearly given special treatment. None of them had to do farm chores. They took lessons from King or Squealer, and were often told not to play with other young animals. Soon, it was announced that any time a pig met another animal on the path, the other animal must stand aside and let the pig pass first. The pigs also started wearing little green ribbons on their tails each Sunday, “to mark their leadership,” Squealer said.

Despite the hardships, the animals found themselves engaging in odd new rituals King introduced—so-called “Spontaneous Demonstrations.” About once a week, a trumpet would blow, and everyone would drop their work to march around the yard in tight formation. The pigs led at the front, the horses and cows behind, then the sheep and poultry, all chanting or singing farm slogans. One day it might be “Hail the Windmill!” the next day it might be “Long Live King!” A band of sheep would bleat “Four legs good, two legs bad!” while the dogs barked in rhythm. It seemed to remind them they were “free” and that their work was all for their own benefit. After a time, many actually looked forward to these shows. It let them briefly forget sore muscles or empty bellies. Squealer would read off lists—milk yield up, egg production doubled, harvest better than any local farm. Then a single shot from the old shotgun signaled the end, and they returned to work, feeling a flicker of pride or at least distraction from daily troubles.

In early summer, Moses the raven reappeared after a long absence. Just as before, he perched on fence posts and spun tales of **Sugarhill Mountain**, that fabled land up beyond the clouds, where every animal rested from toil and sweet treats grew on hedges. Most animals were too exhausted to argue, so some found comfort in Moses’s stories. The pigs publicly dismissed Moses’s preaching as nonsense, but oddly, they let him stay, even giving him an occasional pinch of corn. It was puzzling. Some animals suspected King allowed Moses to keep their minds on the dream of “Sugarhill Mountain” instead of their real hardships.

Through it all, Boxer kept working—and weakening. His once shiny coat was dull; his shoulders, once massive, now poked through his hide. But he refused to slow down, often dragging stone loads alone when others had gone to rest. One evening, while tugging a particularly heavy boulder up a slope, Boxer suddenly collapsed. Clover and Benjamin raced over to him. Boxer lay on his side, breathing heavily, a trickle of blood leaking from his mouth. Trying to rise, he found his hind legs wouldn’t support him.

“Don’t strain,” begged Clover, tears in her eyes. “We’ll go get help.”

Word spread like wildfire through the farm. The pigs sent for Squealer, who assured everyone that King would arrange the best care possible. They helped Boxer limp back to his stall. Clover stayed beside him, licking water over his forehead. Despite pain, Boxer whispered his regrets that he’d likely not see the windmill completed. “If I recover,” he said, “maybe I’ll make it to that retirement corner. Benjamin can join me.” Clover tried to comfort him.

For two days, Boxer lay there. Squealer visited once, repeating that a vet from town was coming and praising King’s generosity. Sure enough, on the third day, a truck rattled up the driveway—a big, closed-sided truck pulled by a couple of draft horses. The words **“Willingdon Horse Slaughterer & Glue Works”** were painted on its side in bold letters. The animals gasped. “No, it can’t be!” cried Clover. “They’re taking Boxer to the knacker’s!” The animals surged forward, shouting and trying to block the truck. Inside, Boxer, too weak to jump out, pressed his muzzle through a tiny slot in the wood, looking confused. They screamed, “Boxer, jump! They’re taking you away!” But Boxer, too weak to force open the heavy door, could only flail his hooves. The driver whipped up the horses, and the truck rumbled down the lane, leaving the animals behind, bleating in desperation.

That evening, Squealer reappeared to “clarify the misunderstanding.” He claimed the vet had recently purchased that old slaughterhouse truck and hadn’t repainted it yet. “Boxer died in the clinic,” Squealer announced solemnly, “despite the best medicine money could buy. He passed on with King’s name on his lips, praising the Rebellion.” In a trembling speech, Squealer recounted how Boxer’s last words were “I will work harder” and “King is always right,” urging all animals to remain loyal. Many animals openly wept, especially Clover. Benjamin, who suspected otherwise, stayed silent, his expression even gloomier than usual.

Not long after, a case of brand-new whiskey arrived at the farmhouse. Mugs clinked and loud singing came from within. The animals heard rumors the pigs had paid for this batch with money from some unknown source. But few dared connect the dots. The next Sunday meeting, King spoke briefly, praising Boxer as a noble fighter who always upheld the motto “I will work harder.” “We should all strive to be like him,” King concluded. The animals mumbled their agreement, then marched in a short parade. Yet inside their hearts, many felt emptier than ever. A quiet realization spread that if even Boxer, their most loyal worker, could be taken away in such a fashion, no one was truly safe. But no one said that out loud. They simply trotted off to the half-rebuilt windmill, heads lowered, their once proud spirits wearing thin.

## CHAPTER X

Years slipped by. The farm’s hardships never truly vanished, though some parts of life seemed smoother to the younger generations. Few animals remained who recalled the first days of the Rebellion. Clover was well past the usual retirement age, yet no retirement pasture ever opened. Muriel had passed on, as had most of the original dogs. Benjamin was older and as gruff as ever; his coat had turned nearly white. He still said little, but was often seen gazing sourly at the windmill. Moses, the old raven, still flew around spouting tales of Sugarhill Mountain.

The farm itself looked more prosperous now. They’d rebuilt the windmill—yet again—and it was actually being used to mill corn, bringing in good money. But the lavish comforts Snowball once promised—heated stalls, electric lighting—never appeared. King explained that this windmill was “just phase one,” and that the real improvements would come later. Meanwhile, the animals toiled the same long hours, or longer, for the pigs’ growing projects. And somehow, the pigs and the dogs always seemed to live well—never missing a meal, never lacking for whiskey. The rest simply worked, surviving on limited rations, occasionally hearing Squealer recite new success figures.

By this point, the farm had grown in acreage—King had bought two adjacent fields from Mr. Pilkington. There were additional barns and a few more outbuildings. Yet for the average beast, the promise of rest and plenty never arrived. The older ones frequently tried to recall if life had been easier in Farmer Johnson’s day or if it was truly better now. They had nothing but dim memories and no written record to help them compare. Squealer’s barrage of numbers insisted that progress was constant, so most ended up nodding along, though they sometimes wondered, in their secret hearts, whether those numbers told the full truth.

Only Benjamin claimed to remember exactly how life used to be, but he’d just say, “It’s always the same—bad or worse,” and leave it at that.

Despite the gloom, there was still pride at Animal Farm. They were the only place where animals ruled themselves. Whenever the green flag rose, or the gun was fired on special days, they felt a flicker of ownership. They chanted those old slogans—“Four legs good, two legs bad!”—though by now the words felt more like a habit than a deep conviction. Many younger animals had never even heard of Snowball or Old Major and barely remembered the Seven Commandments. If they tried to read them on the barn wall, they’d discover the white paint had faded and was now overwritten with something else.

Then, one evening, the sheep launched into a new chant that made many stare in shock: **“Four legs good, two legs better!”** It happened just after the animals witnessed a startling sight: out from the farmhouse door trotted a line of pigs, each walking on hind legs. Leading them was Squealer, wobbling a bit, but definitely upright. Finally, King himself emerged, upright as a human, glancing around with a fierce pride, a whip in his trot—just like Farmer Johnson used to carry. The dogs barked in excitement. The sheep drowned out any possible protest by chanting their newly learned slogan: “Four legs good, two legs better!” No one else dared say a word. From that moment on, the pigs could be seen strolling about the yard upright, barking orders. And if any animal felt disturbed by it, they buried their feelings and said nothing.

A few days later, a group of local farmers arrived for a friendly visit. All these years, King’s negotiations with neighbors had come and gone, but now it seemed ties were finally warming. The animals did their routine chores, noticing that a dinner was taking place in the farmhouse. Curious, they crept near the windows. Inside, they saw King hosting Mr. Pilkington and a few others at a grand table. The pigs sat among the men, passing around bottles of beer, talking and laughing. Mr. Pilkington was making a toast:

“Gentlemen,” he said, “it pleases me that old misunderstandings have been set aside. There was a time our folks worried your ways would rattle up our own livestock. But we see now the discipline on Animal Farm is second to none. Your animals work harder on less feed than any in the county. A fine example! From now on, we aim to be good neighbors.”

The men clapped. King stood, beaming. He declared that the farm’s name would officially revert to **“The Manor Farm,”** which, he said, was its original and correct name. He raised his mug for a final toast: “To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!” They all drank heartily, including the pigs. From outside, Clover, Benjamin, and the others watched. Something odd in the pigs’ faces caught their eyes—the expressions looked less and less like pigs, more and more like the men they sat beside. The animals blinked in confusion, glancing from pig to man, from man to pig, again and again. Their vision seemed to blur. It became impossible to tell which face was which.

As the guests broke into a fresh round of laughter, a quarrel suddenly erupted inside. King and Mr. Pilkington both slapped down the ace of spades at the same time—one of them must have been cheating. Voices rose, chairs scraped. Shouting broke out. Alarmed, the animals outside peered in again. But now they saw only a swirl of angry faces, men and pigs both, so blended that no creature could distinguish them. Startled and frightened, the animals crept away from the window, a cold wind cutting across the yard. Even the sheep were silenced, leaving behind nothing but the distant sound of outraged shouting, rising from that cozy house where humans and pigs feasted together.
