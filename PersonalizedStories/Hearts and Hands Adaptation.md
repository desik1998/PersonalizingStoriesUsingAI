**WHISPERS ON THE RAJDHANI**
---

At **Nagpur Junction**, a flurry of activity accompanied the halting of the **northbound Rajdhani Express** heading toward **New Delhi**. Vendors hurried along the platform, calling out “Chai, chai!” and “Samosa garam!”, while families with large suitcases searched for their coach. Amid this bustle, a graceful young woman in the air-conditioned compartment sat absorbed in the view. She was **Miss Aditi Mehra**, elegantly dressed in a light salwar suit, her posture reflecting the poise of someone used to traveling in comfort.

As soon as the train whistle sounded, the final passengers rushed in. Among them were two men entering the coach in an unusual manner: they were **handcuffed** together at the wrist. One was tall and broad-shouldered, with a grim, no-nonsense face. He wore slightly worn trousers and a rumpled shirt. The other man, younger and more debonair, wore crisp casuals—a half-sleeve shirt and well-fitted trousers. Both glanced around, searching for empty seats.

The only vacant spot lay opposite Miss Mehra, on a pair of reversed seats facing her. The two men settled there, their chained wrists making a distinct clink. Other passengers darted quick glances, but nobody wanted to stare outright. Miss Mehra’s initial look at the new arrivals was brief and politely uninterested. However, her expression soon changed when she caught sight of the younger man’s features. Her eyes lit up with surprise, followed by a warm smile.

“**Mr. Malhotra!** Arey, if I hadn’t spoken first, you’d have pretended not to recognize me at all,” she said, her voice confident and clear, the way someone used to attention would speak. She extended her right hand, but then hesitated, noticing the glint of steel binding him to the other man.

The younger man blinked, recovering swiftly from his own momentary embarrassment. He took her offered hand with his left. “**Miss Mehra**…” he said, forcing an apologetic grin, “Excuse my other hand—it’s…tied up right now.”

He raised the wrist that was shackled to his traveling companion. For an instant, Aditi’s eyes flickered with disbelief, then confusion, and finally dread. A faint flush drained from her cheeks. She tried to steady herself, placing her free hand on her lap.

Her old friend, **Rohan Malhotra**, let out a small laugh, as though trying to smooth over the uncomfortable moment, but the older man spoke first. He had been observing Miss Mehra through half-lowered lids, reading her reaction with a shrewdness not immediately apparent.

“You’ll forgive me for butting in, madam,” the glum-faced man began in an oddly respectful tone, “But it seems you know our **DSP Malhotra** here. I’m just hoping, when we reach **Tihar Jail**, you might ask him to put in a good word for me. I hear it can make things smoother if the officer is cooperative. It’s **seven years** for counterfeiting currency these days.”

Aditi inhaled sharply. She glanced from the older man’s serious expression to Rohan’s forced smile. “Oh! So…you’re an officer now?” she ventured, forcing her thoughts back into place. “I wondered what brought you all the way here. I thought you were still part of that Delhi crowd—political get-togethers and all.”

Rohan gave a light shrug, his manner calm and unhurried. “I had to do something. You know how life in Delhi goes: money flies away faster than you can blink. After a while, it wasn’t so easy keeping pace with everyone from the old circles. So I looked for a job that offered stability. Becoming a DSP in the **Indian Police Service** isn’t as elite as a diplomatic posting, but…” He trailed off with a disarming smile.

**Miss Mehra** lowered her gaze, choosing her words carefully. “You must know, Rohan… The so-called ‘big shots’ you used to spend time with? They really weren’t worth the fuss. And they certainly weren’t the ones I cared about.” She shook her head slightly, as if dismissing that entire chapter of her life. Then a hint of curiosity resurfaced. “But…to see you in uniform… dealing with criminals and traveling with them on a train? This is all very different from how we used to meet in Delhi parties.”

She stole another look at the **handcuffs**, an unwanted fascination taking hold. Their metallic glint seemed to mock her fond memories. The older man caught her gaze and offered a courteous nod. “Don’t worry, madam. Handcuffs are standard protocol so we don’t lose our culprit on these long train rides. Malhotra Ji knows exactly what he’s doing.”

“Will you return to Delhi anytime soon?” Aditi asked softly.

“Not for a while,” Rohan answered, exhaling in resignation. “Delhi’s pomp and show is behind me for now. Long postings in remote areas, official duties—my days of roaming free are over.”

Aditi turned her head toward the window as farmland and small station platforms blurred by. She lowered her voice, as though confiding in him. “I’ve spent the last month with my mother in **Bhopal**. She went back to **Mumbai** last week because my father isn’t well. But I liked traveling through central India. The air seems good for me. Sometimes, you realize money and status aren’t everything after all.”

Rohan managed a gentle nod, but before he could respond, the older man tugged meaningfully on the connecting chain. “Sir, I hate to interrupt, but I haven’t had a smoke the entire day. And I could use some tea if possible. It’s not right to keep me waiting so long, hai na? I’m at your mercy, after all.”

Despite the tension in the compartment, Rohan smiled faintly at the wry humor. “Alright, Inspector—uh, sorry.” He cleared his throat, feigning a minor slip. “We can’t deny a man his chai and a quick break. Goodbye for now, Aditi. Duty calls, you know.” He extended his free hand in farewell.

She shook it gently, her composure returning. “Too bad you’re not heading to Mumbai,” she remarked, slipping on her polite tone again. “But I suppose Tihar Jail can’t wait.”

“No. I suppose it can’t.” Rohan said

They rose and carefully made their way toward the doorway connecting to the next coach, where smoking was more tolerated (though officially restricted). Passengers, jolted by the movement of the train, parted to let them pass. **Clink, clink** went the handcuffs, drawing eyes from curious onlookers.

Seated nearby were two men—both middle-aged, on their way to Delhi for a family function. One of them, dressed in a simple kurta, chuckled softly. “That officer seems nice. Young and confident”

The other man, adjusting his reading glasses, frowned skeptically. “Young indeed. But…did you notice something odd? The cuffs were on the officer’s **right** hand and have you ever seen an IPS officer ever cuff his prisoner to his strong hand?”
