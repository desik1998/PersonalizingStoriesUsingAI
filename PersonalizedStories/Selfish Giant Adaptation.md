**THE LANDLORD's AWAKENING**
---

Every afternoon, once their school is done, a group of children would rush off laughing and shouting to play in the big _bagh_ behind the old landlord’s sprawling haveli. The gate was usually unlatched, and the children darted in happily. It was a vast, peaceful garden with lush green grass that stayed soft under bare feet, and here and there colorful flowers peeked out like small lanterns. Around the edges stood a dozen tall mango and guava trees, whose branches hung low with leaves. In the springtime, the mango blossoms were pale and fragrant, and later in the year the branches yielded sweet fruit. Parrots and mynahs perched on the trees, chirping and squawking so cheerfully that the children often paused their games just to listen. “Yeh kitna sukoon wala jagah hai!” they would say to one another.

One day, the old landlord returned to his haveli after nearly five years away. He had spent this time traveling to various places across India, far from the quiet village. Long ago, he had taken an oath to God that if he ever became a wealthy landowner, he would dedicate some of his fortune to spiritual pursuits. Upon his arrival, he noticed a noisy group of children running around in his bagh.

“What are you doing in my garden?” he growled angrily. Surprised by his loud voice, the children dropped the sticks and pebbles they had been playing with and ran away at once.

“Yeh bagh toh mera hai,” muttered the landlord. “Why should I share it with anyone else?” So, without a second thought, he ordered workers to build a tall brick wall around the property. When the wall was finished, he put up a new board on the locked gate:

**PRIVATE PROPERTY – NO ENTRY**
**निजी संपत्ति – भीतर आना मना है!**

He was a very selfish old landlord.

The poor children had nowhere to play now. They tried passing time on the dusty village road, but the stone-filled path hurt their feet sometimes, and the hot sun made it uncomfortable. Sometimes, in the evenings, they would gather around the walls of the landlord’s bagh, talking about the wonderful grass and leafy branches inside. “Kya rang-birangi jagah thi!” they reminisced

Days rolled on, and spring returned to the fields and the village. All around, the fields brightened with new crops, and birdcalls filled the air. But inside the landlord’s walled bagh, it remained dull and lifeless. No birds visited there, for there were no children to welcome. The trees somehow forgot how to flower. Once, a little hibiscus blossom peeked out of the ground, but upon seeing the warning board, it vanished back into the soil, sad for the locked-out kids. The only ones who seemed pleased were the cold winds and dryness. They claimed the place for themselves, swirling through empty branches and layering dust over the grass. Weeks passed, and the landlord sat by his window, staring at his gloom-ridden bagh. “Why is the weather behaving so oddly?” he would say. “Spring seems to have passed us by!”

But the skies over his garden never cleared, and the warmth never came. Even as monsoon clouds arrived for the surrounding fields, the landlord’s garden remained still and silent. The mango and guava trees produced no fruit. The old landlord turned more sullen each day. “It’s all so barren,” he grumbled. “I don’t understand what’s wrong with this bagh.”

One morning, after a restless night, he suddenly heard a sweet sound near his window. It was the melodious cry of a koel. He had not heard a bird sing in his own garden for so long that the simple tune gladdened his heart. He quickly stood up, and to his surprise realized the dust storms had gone quiet. He sniffed the air and noticed a faint fragrance, like mango blossoms in bloom. “Maybe spring has arrived at last!” he exclaimed, and hurried to his balcony to see.

What he saw startled him. Through a small opening in the back wall, a group of children had crept in and were climbing the mango and guava trees. Everywhere he looked, those dry, leafless branches now shimmered with fresh blooms. The grass seemed to have grown greener overnight, and marigolds popped up among the shrubs. The birds flew around joyously, and even the breeze felt gentle and refreshing. Only in one far corner of the bagh did the dust and cold remain. There stood a tiny boy, too short to reach the branches of a massive jamun tree. He kept circling under it, crying in frustration. The jamun tree tried bending its branches down to help the boy climb, but still he couldn’t reach.

Looking at this pitiable scene, the landlord felt a sudden wave of regret. “What a fool I have been!” he thought. “Now I see why everything stayed barren all this time. I should help that little boy climb up.” With a newfound determination, he decided to tear down the walls and let the children play whenever they wanted.

He quietly tiptoed downstairs and unlocked the door leading into the bagh. But the moment the children noticed him, they got so scared that they scattered in all directions. And with them went the sunshine, leaving those branches bare again. Dust swirled back over the grass. The little boy in the corner, however, did not run; his eyes were blurred with tears. He hadn’t even noticed the landlord coming near.

Softly, the old man scooped up the child in his arms, placed him on the branch, and patted the tree trunk. Instantly, the tree burst into fresh blossoms. The leaves turned radiant, and the koel started singing. The little boy wrapped his arms around the landlord’s neck and kissed him on the cheek. Seeing that their old landlord was no longer angry or selfish, the other children ran back into the bagh, laughing and shouting. Along with them sprang the sweet fragrance of blossoms, the bright sun, and all the life that had been missing. The landlord picked up his sturdy stick and began knocking down the brick wall. Neighbors passing by at noon stared in amazement to find children playing merrily and the landlord smiling among them in a bagh transformed with lush green grass and blossoming trees.

The children played all day until the sun began to set. While they said their goodbyes, the landlord asked, “Where is that little friend of yours, the boy I helped climb the jamun tree? I liked him the most because he showed me kindness.”

They shook their heads. “We don’t know, uncle. He just disappeared. We’ve never seen him before this, nor do we know where he lives.”

The landlord felt an ache in his heart. “Tell him to come again tomorrow,” he said softly, “I want to meet him.”

But the children had no answer. Each afternoon after school, they returned to play in the bagh, and the landlord was kind to them all. Yet that tiny boy never showed up again. As years passed, the landlord grew older and weaker. He could no longer run or climb trees, so he’d watch the children frolic in the tall grass from a big armchair placed in the shade. “I have seen so many beautiful flowers, but these children are more precious than any bloom,” he would say, sighing now and then as he remembered the child who had kissed him.

One winter morning, he gazed out of his window while dressing. The cold wind no longer bothered him, for he believed winter was simply nature resting before the next bright season. Suddenly, he blinked in surprise. Way at the back corner of the garden, a huge guava tree stood covered in pure white blossoms, as if shining. It seemed out of place in the middle of winter. The branches gleamed like gold, and silver-like fruit glistened among the leaves. Beneath it stood the same little boy he had missed for all these years.

With his heart pounding in excitement, the landlord hurried downstairs and strode across the damp grass. As he approached, he saw deep marks on the boy’s palms and faint bruises on his small feet. Horrified, the old man cried, “Who dared harm you like this? Tell me, so I can punish them!”

The little boy answered softly, “No, these wounds are marks of love.”

A sudden awe fell upon the landlord as he looked at the child’s serene face. Kneeling in respect, he asked, “Who are you?”

The boy smiled tenderly and said, “You once let me play in your bagh. Today, I’ve come to invite you to mine—_my_ garden, which lies beyond this world.”

Later that afternoon, when the local villagers peeked inside the bagh, they found the old landlord resting peacefully beneath the blooming tree, his eyes closed forever, his face calm and content. Around him, gentle petals of the white blossoms drifted in the winter breeze.

And so ended the story of the once-selfish landlord, who learned that true happiness lies in sharing what we have with others. And, in the hearts of the children, his bagh remained open, warm, and brimming with life—always.
