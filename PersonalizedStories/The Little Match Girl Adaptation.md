**The Little Match Girl**
---

It was a cold, foggy night in late December—the very last evening of the year. A bitter chill whipped through the busy lanes of the old city. Streetlights shimmered in the haze, and the distant honking of rickshaws blended with the buzz of final New Year’s Eve shoppers. Tucked away along a crowded sidewalk, a poor little girl was trying to sell matchboxes. She wore a thin, tattered kurta, and her feet were bare except for one battered rubber chappal. The other was swept into the gutter and got swept away.

Her tiny toes had turned pale red from the biting cold. All day, she had stood near the traffic signal, calling out, “Matches! Ten rupees! Matches! Ten rupees!” But no one stopped to buy even a single box. She hadn’t even eaten since morning, and her father would be angry if she went back home empty-handed. Their makeshift hut was drafty with gaps in the corrugated tin roof, stuffed with rags and plastic sheets. In such bitter winter, the wind ripped right through it. She feared both the chilling wind and her father’s scoldings.

The night grew heavier, the fog thickening until the tall buildings were almost invisible. Bright lights from a nearby banquet hall glowed like colorful stars against the mist. A mouthwatering aroma drifted across the street—someone was cooking chicken biryani, or maybe kebabs on a charcoal grill. It was New Year’s Eve, after all and people were celebrating with music, food, and laughter.

Shivering, the girl clutched a small stack of matchboxes in her worn kurta. She remembered how, last Diwali, her grandmother had taught her to light a diya with a gentle strike of a match. Grandmother’s hands were warm; she had always been kind, telling her stories and hugging her when the nights felt lonely. But the grandmother is now gone. The girl lived only with her drunken father, who had no patience for her.

At length, she sank into a corner where one wall jutted out more than the other, creating a shallow nook that offered meager shelter from the cold. Her feet curled beneath her to keep warm, but the chill cut through her thin clothes. She dared not go home without selling at least some matches; she would receive only anger, perhaps a beating. Her stomach growled, and her fingers had gone nearly numb.

She looked down at the boxes. *If I only light one match,* she thought, *it might warm my hands for a moment.* With trembling fingers, she struck a matchstick against the rough edge of a stone. “Ssssht!” The tiny flame flared up. In its warm, flickering glow, the girl imagined she was sitting inside a cozy little room in front of an angithi. The metal stand glowed with hot coals that radiated soothing warmth to her hands and feet. She smiled, trying to stretch her legs to soak in the heat. But just then, the flame flickered and died. The angithi disappeared, and she was back in her cold corner.

She quickly lit another match. This time, it revealed a transparent vision in the wall: a grand family feast, set out on a large wooden table. There were bowls of steaming dal, fluffy rotis puffed up with ghee, golden rice flecked with spices, and a big pot of fragrant biryani. The smell was so real she almost believed she could eat. The best part was a plate of sizzling paneer tikka, its aroma wafting as though it was right under her nose. Her mouth watered, and she felt a moment of pure delight. Then the match went out. The mouthwatering sight vanished into the darkness, replaced by the cold grey of the crumbling cement wall.

Undeterred, she struck a third match. In a warm glow, she found herself gazing into a beautifully decorated living room. A tall houseplant glittered with tiny electric lights, ribbons, and a few bright paper stars hung from its branches. Children were dancing around it, laughing and exchanging small gifts. One boy squealed with joy over a sparking phuljhari leftover from Diwali. The new year celebration shimmered in her eyes like a dream. She reached out, hoping to catch just a spark of that happiness, but the match sputtered out again. Darkness rushed in, and the distant fireworks outside felt even lonelier than before.

A sudden burst of color lit the night sky above the city—people were bursting crackers and setting off fireworks in celebration of the coming year. She looked up as one bright streak of light shot across the fog. “Someone’s soul is finding its way to the divine,” the little girl whispered softly, remembering her grandmother’s words about falling stars being the messengers of a soul’s journey to moksha, the eternal liberation

She lit yet another match, and in the quiet glow, she saw her grandmother’s gentle face hovering before her. The old woman looked so peaceful, with the same warm smile and kind eyes that had once brought comfort to the little girl’s world. “Grandmother, please take me with you,” the child pleaded. “Don’t vanish like the angithi, or the feast, or the New Year decorations. I can’t bear this cold anymore. Please stay!”

Fearing that this vision, too, would disappear when the flame died, she frantically struck match after match. An entire bundle flared up all at once, filling the corner with brilliant light. The grandmother’s figure grew clearer than ever, radiating a gentle warmth. She scooped the little girl into her arms, and together they rose, as if carried by a soft wind. They soared away from the freezing street and the harsh cries of the world, up to a place where fear and hunger could no longer reach her.

When the first morning light crept through the blanket of fog, the bustling city awakened to another new year. Shopkeepers opened their shutters, hawkers yelled out fresh deals, and rickshaw-wallahs debated fares. In that little corner, someone noticed a small figure huddled against the wall. The little girl was lying there, eyes gently closed, lips curved in a tender smile. Her cheeks still looked pink, but she had slipped away in the quiet hours before dawn.

Near her lay the burned-out matchsticks, a silent testimony to her final moments of comfort. Passersby murmured, “Poor child—maybe she just wanted to warm herself.” Nobody suspected the visions of light and love she had seen. No one imagined how, in a final burst of hope, she found her grandmother and left the cruel winter behind forever. 

Thus, the little match girl stepped into the new year, unnoticed by the hurried world. But far beyond the realm of human suffering, her spirit soared free—released like the sacred diya floating on a river’s current, merging with the eternal light. She was no longer bound by cold or hunger; instead, she found herself embraced in the warmth of her grandmother’s loving arms, a refuge that would never fade. Her journey had ended in a place of peace, where the soul rests in the timeless glow of divinity, untouched by the trials of the world.
